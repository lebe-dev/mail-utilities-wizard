# Mail Utilities Wizard

**Status:** Work in progress

A tiny web-service that helps send meter readings to utility companies.

[На русском](README.ru.md)

## My story

My aged parents send house counters to different public utilities by mail. Such companies don't have any web-sites or mobile apps.
Each utility company has own letter format requirements. It makes my parents to suffer.

## How it works

A service provides web interface for user:

- Location
- Type of counter (water, electricity)
- Value
- Send button

## RoadMap

1. Support state for each location
2. Remember about counters via mail
